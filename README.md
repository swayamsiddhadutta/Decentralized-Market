# Decentralized-Market
Companies like eBay,Amazon,OLX have been going strong in the e-commerce business for quite sometime now.
Amazon is the biggest e-commerce company,going strong for 20 years now.Looking at these companies,I wanted to know the entire mechanism of how these companies work and therefore I wanted to try my own version of that.However, on initial thought i could understand that the database for such a purpose could get very large very soon.
<br><br>
Therefore I wanted to use the ethereum blockchain as the distributed database for this application and maintain an off-chain database for simple searching and filtering.My personal interest towards such a decentralized application arose after I started learning building basic dApps(decentralized applications) and I started learning that supply chain management is one of the best applications of the blockchain and all its consensus mechanisms.
<br><br>
Here the working is as basic as in any Decentralized application.
